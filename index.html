<h2> About </h2>  
<p> This is Mimi, a mysterious creature who likes to talk to humans! Why not ask her a question or two? </p> 
<p>She's still training, so there's a lot she can't say or do. Ask her anything you can think of, and it will help her to train later! </p> 
<p>Not sure what to say? Try saying hi, how you're feeling, or asking about her!</p>
